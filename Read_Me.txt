#what is this Project
 This project is collection of my video library (Movies and TVShow) , as an assignment

#What you Need to Run this
   You would need python installed on system and need to have fresh_tomatoes.py in same folder. 
   This program uses fresh_tomatoes file which is been twicked to show duration of the video. 

#implementation 
   I have used inheritance concept  and Parent “Video” is used by “Movie” and TVShow. There is method 
   called show_trailer() which is used by both the “Movie” and “TVShow” class.  I have kept both “Movie” and “TVShow” 
   is same class as “vVdeo” for convenience. 

#Future scope
   Future would like to add method to fresh_tomatoes class so that I could have different implementation for TV shows.
